# Goodreads-project

This repository provides the code and visualisations used in a medium blogpost about Goodreads data. The project looks at some descriptive statistics about the kinds of books on Goodreads.

The libraries used (optional -- how to install)
The motivation for the project (this should be a bit more detail -- why was this project chosen?)
The files in the repository with a small description of each
A summary of the results of the analysis (can include a brief sentence summarizing the answer to each of your asked questions)

The data was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/goodreads-books). NB: Very large file
