# Goodreads-project

## Description & Motivation
This repository provides the code and visualisations used in a medium blogpost about Goodreads data. The project looks at some descriptive statistics about the kinds of books on Goodreads. 

I like books and I like data. So I wanted to create fun and interesting visualistions where these two pleasures of mine intersect. I wanted to see if there were any immediately observable trends about popular books in the data. 


### Results
The main findings of the analysis are documented in a medium blogpost. \
